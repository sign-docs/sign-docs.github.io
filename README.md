## 🔒 Our Commitment to Privacy

Privacy is the core feature of sign-docs. In an age where data privacy is paramount, we've built this tool to operate entirely on the client-side.

- **No Uploads**: Your files are opened and processed directly within your web browser. They are never sent to or stored on any server.
- **No Tracking**: We do not track you or the content of your documents.
- **No Data Retention**: Since no data ever reaches us, we have nothing to retain. Your session is ephemeral and all data is cleared when you close the page.

You can use sign-docs with the confidence that your sensitive information remains in your control at all times.
